# geopropsdb-geochem

This repository contains ETL scripts, queries, templates etc. to transfer data from the MS Access DB [Whole of Queensland Geochemistry databases](https://geoscience.data.qld.gov.au/data/geochemistry/whole-of-queensland-geochemistry-databases) to the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq)'s **[GeoPropertiesDB](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/geological-properties-database)** which is a Postgres DB _Master Dataset_.

This code is ultimately for one-time use only: once a successful trasfer has been made, the Whole of Queensland Geochemistry databases will no longer be maintained in MS Access form or, if they are, they will be exports of the GeoPropertiesDB and thus generated from a source, not maintained as a point-of-truth.
